# Daily JavaScript Coding Challenges

## Overview

I am building a consistent daily practice of solving coding challenges alongside my regular project work.

## Challenge Sources

### Primary Source

- **FreeCodeCamp Daily Coding Challenges**  
  [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive)

### Additional Practice

- **FreeCodeCamp Coding Interview Prep**  
  [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)

## Repository Structure

### File Naming Convention

- Files without additional descriptions contain **my original solutions**
- Files with descriptors like `(enhanced)`, `(one-line)`, or `(functional-approach)` contain **alternative solutions** from other sources

### Learning Workflow

1. **Solve independently** - Create my own solution first
2. **Research alternatives** - Study different approaches and implementations
3. **Archive insights** - Document improved solutions for future reference

## Goals

- Build consistent problem-solving habits
- Enhance JavaScript proficiency
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Explore diverse solution approaches
- Create a personal coding challenge library

## Finding Problem Sources

To locate the original problem for any solution:

1. Visit the Daily Challenges archive:  
   [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive)

2. Select the date mentioned in the folder name  
   _Example: For folder "Daily Challenges 2025/Caught Speeding - Sep 26", select September 26_

3. Find the matching problem title on the archive page

I will include direct problem descriptions and sources in each challenge folder moving forward.
